    An article is basically a direct conversation with your reader. If a portion in an exam is for you to write an article, the reader may be identified or specified as part of the instructions. That way you can write your article as if you are directly discussing your topic with them. In this sense, the tone, sentences, and words you use in your article must be conversational and easy to understand for your readers. More importantly, you need to remember that the main goal is to cater to your readers; you need to be able to spark their interest and sustain in all throughout the article.
  </p>
  <p><h1><a id="article2"></a>Article 2:</h1></p>
  <p>
    The main thing that sparks you readers’ interest is your title. Since the title is the first few descriptive words your readers will be able to read before the content of the article, it must be attention-getting, meaning, it must be catchy but still has substance. The title of your article must represent the entirety of your article, therefore, it must be accurate but at the same time interesting. After establishing a good title for your article, the content should definitely match what is in the title; it must be accurate and at the same time factual.

  <p><h1><a id="article3"></a>Article 3:</h1></p>
  <p>
    Similarly to what has been discussed above, an article needs to be interesting. Aside from being informative and factual, another goal should be to be able to maintain the readers’ interest in your content. The article must be engaging from start to finish. If you are writing an article for an exam, you must remember that your teacher has to read quite a few articles of the same main topic. You have to think of a way to make your article interesting and memorable, maybe try a new approach, use more engaging sentences; you have to find a way to make you reader want to read your article up to the last word. For example, you can add humor (if appropriate), real-life or made-up examples, or make up quotes.

  <p><h1><a id="article4"></a>Article 4:</h1></p>
  <p>
    One common mistake when writing articles is being overwhelmed by the topic and writing an entire page of monotonous rambles. Although in some cases it is necessary, like in a news or editorial article. However, there are ways when you can make it a breeze to read for your readers; for example, you can use subheadings to break up the text and make clear paragraphs. Make sure that your ideas are organized in a way that your readers can easily comprehend, you can write in a semi-informal, conversational style; however, you may want to abide to the instructions that you will be given. Remember that in an article, there is no need to reiterate the issue or topic, you really only have to explore and expand the topic to encourage your reader to read on.
  </p>
  <p><h1><a id="article5"></a>Article 5:</h1></p>
  <p>
    The difference with an essay and an article is that in an essay you need to sum up the point you have made in the entire write-up in your conclusion while in an article, there is no need for that; the best way to end your article is to give the reader something to ponder even after reading the entirety of the article. Most of the time, the best endings link back to the starting point in some way. You can ask a question or some powerful or impactful sentence that will make your readers think about what they have read.
